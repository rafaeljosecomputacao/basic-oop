Constructor, overloading and encapsulation

Exercise 4:
To register for a bank account, you must provide the account number, the account holder's
name and the initial deposit amount the account holder deposited when opening the account.

This initial deposit amount is optional. Once a bank account has been opened, the account
number can never be changed. The account balance cannot be freely changed. The balance
only increases through deposits and decreases through withdrawals. The deposit and
withdrawal amount must be greater than zero. The withdrawal amount cannot be greater
than the balance.

You must create a program that registers an account, giving the option to enter the initial
deposit amount or not. Then make a deposit and a withdrawal, displaying the account details
after each transaction.

Example:
Enter the account number: 3250
Enter the account holder: Max Cage
Would you like to make an initial deposit (y/n)? y
Enter the initial deposit amount: 500.00

Account details:
Number: 3250, Holder: Max Cage, Balance: $ 500.00

Enter the deposit amount: 200.00
Deposit successful
Updated account data:
Number: 3250, Holder: Max Cage, Balance: $ 700.00

Enter the amount to withdraw: 300.00
Withdrawal successful
Updated account data:
Number: 3250, Holder: Max Cage, Balance: $ 400.00

Memory behavior, arrays and lists

Exercise 5:
A hotel has ten rooms for rent. The rooms are labeled 1 through 10.

Write a program that starts with all rooms empty and then reads how many rooms will be
rented. Record guest rentals. For each rental record, enter the guest's name, email
address and room number. Print a report of all guests by room number.

Example:
How many rooms will be rented? 3

Rent #1:
Name: Oliver Wilson
Email: oliver@email.com
Room: 3

Rent #2:
Name: Harper Moore
Email: harper@email.com
Room: 1

Rent #3:
Name: Michael Miller
Email: michael@email.com
Room: 10

Occupied rooms:
1: Harper Moore, harper@email.com
3: Oliver Wilson, oliver@email.com
10: Michael Miller, michael@email.com

Exercise 6:
Create a program to register employee data (id, name and salary). Consider not repeating ids.

Increase a specific employee's salary by a given percentage. The program should read an id and
the percentage value. If the specified id doesn't exist, display a message and abort the
operation. Display the list of employees.

Example:
How many employees will be registered? 2

Employee #1:
Id: 320
Name: Ethan Davis
Salary: 2000.00

Employee #2:
Id: 350
Name: Joseph Johnson
Salary: 3000.00

Enter the id of the employee whose salary will be increased: 350
Enter the percentage: 10.0

List of employees:
Id: 320, Name: Ethan Davis, Salary: $ 2000.00
Id: 350, Name: Joseph Johnson, Salary: $ 3300.00
